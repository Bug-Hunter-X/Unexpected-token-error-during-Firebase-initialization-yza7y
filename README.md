# Unexpected Token Error During Firebase Initialization

This repository demonstrates a solution for an uncommon Firebase initialization bug.

The solution focuses on ensuring proper module imports and confirming correct Firebase package versions.  The specific solution may vary depending on the underlying cause, but this example highlights common approaches to resolving such import-related errors.
